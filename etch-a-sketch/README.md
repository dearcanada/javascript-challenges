# Etch-a-Sketch
Implementation of The Odin Project (Foundations Course) assignment: Etch-a-Sketch.
Simply hover your mouse over the canvas and configure settings or modes.

# Features:

1. Create sketches with custom settings. Set a maximum number of grid squares per side (up to 100)

2. Darkening mode available. Pixels progressively disappear over 10 hover interactions

3. Reset current sketch while preserving its settings. Clear the canvas and disable darkening mode with its progress

4. Simple and clean UI. Just three buttons

I implemented all the features described in the assignment, even though I wasn't previously familiar with the "etch-a-sketch" app.

# Assignment Notes:

Added grid customization button with maximum 100 squares per side

Extra credit: Implemented progressive darkening effect (10% per interaction)
